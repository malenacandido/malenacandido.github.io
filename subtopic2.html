The site always provides statistics based on surveys conducted on teachers, students, and school districts, each sharing shocking results. The authors demonstrate that what's thought of as an easy solution isn't necessarily helpful, as teachers are struggling to properly enforce new cell phone policies in class. The article finished by showing that teens themselves believe that the pros of cellphone usage outweigh the cons, which is a sad and false opinion.  </span><br>
